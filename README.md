## Introduction 
The goal of this paper is to understand the movement and oscillations of a hanging chain
with one end fixed as shown in Figure 1. The oscillations of a hanging chain is a foundational
differential equations problem which was first solved by Jacob Bernoulli (1655-1705) and
was the first use of Bessel functions [3, Wilson (1908)]. Since its discovery, the hanging
chain equation has been applied to many modern systems, some of which include satellite
structures, suspension cables, and robotic arm mechanics. In this paper, we will begin by
deriving the hanging chain equation through mechanics. Then we will find an equation to
describe the general motion of a hanging chain.
